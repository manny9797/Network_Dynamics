# Network dynamics and learning

We dealt with topological and algebraic graph theory. The assignment is divided into three different exercises:

• In the first we are given a network and its link capacities.

• In the second there is a list of people with characteristics to link.

• In the more realistic third one there is to analyze the lines of highways in the city of Los Angles.
